NAME
    norm - calculate a norm of a value

SYNOPSIS
    norm(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, the function xx_norm has to have been
    defined; what this does will be determined by the definition.

    For non-object x:

    x		number (real or complex)

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    For real x, norm(x) returns:

	 x^2.

    For complex x, norm(x) returns:

	re(x)^2 + im(x)^2.

EXAMPLE
    > print norm(3.4), norm(-3.4), norm(3 + 4i), norm(4 - 5i)
    11.56 11.56 25 41

LIMITS
    none

LIBRARY
    void normvalue(VALUE *x, VALUE *result)
