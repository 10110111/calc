NAME
    strncpy - copy a number of chracters from head or all of a stringr
		to head or all of a string

SYNOPSIS
    strncpy(s1, s2, n)

TYPES
    s1		string
    s2		string
    n		nonnegative integer

    return	string

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(n2), and m = min(n1, n2, n).
    This function replaces the first m characters of s1 by the first
    m characters of s2, and if min(n1, n) > n2, replaces the next
    min(n1,n) - n2 characters of s1 by '\0'. The size of s1 and any
    later characters of s1 are unchanged. The function returns s1, with
    new value.
 
EXAMPLE
    strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 0) == "abcdef"
