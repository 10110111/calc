NAME
    strncmp - compare two strings up to a specified number of characters 

SYNOPSIS
    strncmp(s1, s2, n)

TYPES
    s1		string
    s2		string
    n		nonnegative integer

    return	integer (1, 0 or -1)

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(s2) and m = min(n1, n2, n).
    This function compares up to m values of consecutive characters
    in the strings s1 and s2. If an inequality is encountered, the
    function returns 1 or -1 according as the greater character is
    in s1 or s2. If there has been no inequality, the function
    returns 1, 0, or -1 according as min(n1, n) is greater than, equal
    to, or less than min(n2, n); in particular, if n1 and n2 are
    both greater than equal to n, 0 is returned.
 

EXAMPLE
strncmp("abc", "xyz", 0) == 0
strncmp("abc", "xyz", 1) == -1
strncmp("abc", "", 1) == 1
strncmp("a", "b", 2) == -1
strncmp("ab", "ac", 2) == -1
strncmp("\0ac", "\0b", 2) == -1
strncmp("ab", "abc", 2) == 0
strncmp("abc", "abd", 2) == 0


LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    This function uses FLAG stringrel(STRING *s1, STRING *s2),
    temporarily replacing the string sizes by min(n1,n) and min(n2,n).
