NAME
    highbit - index of highest bit in binary representation of integer

SYNOPSIS
    highbit(x)

TYPES
    x		nonzero integer

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x is a nonzero integer, highbit(x) returns the index of the
    highest bit in the binary representation of abs(x).  Equivalently,
    highbit(x) = n if 2^n <= abs(x) < 2^(n + 1);  the binary
    representation of x then has n + 1 digits.

EXAMPLE
    > print highbit(2), highbit(3), highbit(4), highbit(-15), highbit(2^27)
    1 1 2 3 27

LIMITS
    none

LIBRARY
    LEN zhighbit(ZVALUE x);

SEE ALSO
    lowbit, digits
