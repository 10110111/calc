NAME
    fopen - open a file

SYNOPSIS
    fopen(filename, mode)

TYPES
    filename	string
    mode	string

    return	file

DESCRIPTION
    This function opens the file named filename.  A file can be
    opened for either reading, writing, or appending.  The mode
    is controlled by the mode flag as follows:

	"r"	reading
	"w"	writing
	"a"	appending

    Names of files are subject to ~ expansion just like the C or
    Korn shell.	 For example, the file name:

	~/lib/gleet

    refers to the file 'gleet' under the directory lib located
    in your home directory.  The file name:

	~chongo/was_here

    refers to the a file 'was_here' under the home directory of
    the user 'chongo'.

    If the open is successful, a value of type 'file' will be returned.
    You can use the 'isfile' function to test the return value to see
    if the open succeeded.  You should assign the return value of fopen
    to a variable for later use.  File values can be copied to more than
    one variable, and using any of the variables with the same file value
    will produce the same results.

    Standard input, standard output and standard error are always opened
    and cannot be closed.

    The truth value of an opened file is TRUE.

    If the open is unsuccessful, the numeric value of errno is returned.
    You can the errno() builtin to determine what the errno number means.

EXAMPLE
    > fd = fopen("/etc/motd", "r")
    > print fd
    "/etc/motd"
    > fd
	    FILE 3 "/etc/motd" (reading, pos 0)

    > outfile = fopen("~/tmp/output", "w")
    > print outfile
    "~/tmp/output"
    > outfile
	    FILE 4 "~/tmp/output" (writing, pos 0)

    > badfile = fopen("not_a_file", "r")
    > if (!isfile(badfile)) print "error #" : badfile : ":", errno(badfile);
    error #2: No such file or directory

LIMITS
