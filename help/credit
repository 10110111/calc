    The majority of calc was written by David I. Bell.

    Calc archives and calc-tester mailing list maintained by Landon Curt Noll.

    Thanks for suggestions and encouragement from Peter Miller,
    Neil Justusson, and Landon Noll.

    Thanks to Stephen Rothwell for writing the original version of
    hist.c which is used to do the command line editing.

    Thanks to Ernest W. Bowen for supplying many improvements in
    accuracy and generality for some numeric functions.  Much of
    this was in terms of actual code which I gratefully accepted.
    Ernest also supplied the original text for many of the help files.

    Portions of this program are derived from an earlier set of
    public domain arbitrarily precision routines which was posted
    to the net around 1984.  By now, there is almost no recognizable
    code left from that original source.
