We welcome and encourage you to send us:

    * calc resource files
    * calc shell scripts
    * any builtin functions that you have modified or written
    * custom functions that you have modified or written
    * any other source code modifications

Prior to doing so, you should consider applying your changes to the most
recent version of calc.

Landon Noll maintains the official calc home page at:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/

See:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-download.html

for information on how to obtain up a recent version of calc.

In order to consider integrating your code, we need:

    * the calc version you are working with (use the latest calc, see above)
    * new help files or help file patches, if applicable (documentation)
    * proposed text for the CHANGES file (brief description of what it does)
    * regress.cal test patch, if applicable
    * your source code and/or source code changes (:-))

The best way to send us new code, if your changes are small, is
via a patch (diff -c from the latest alpha code to your code).
If your change is large, you should send entire files (either
as a diff -c /dev/null your-file patch, or as a uuencoded and
gziped (or compressed) tar file).

You should send submissions to:

    calc-contrib at asthe dot com

    [[ NOTE: Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]
    [[ NOTE: The EMail address uses 'asthe' and the web site URL uses 'isthe' ]]

Thanks for considering submitting code to calc.	 Calc is a collective
work by a number of people.  It would not be what it is today without
your efforts and submissions!

Calc bug reports, however, should be sent to:

    calc-bugs at asthe dot com

    [[ NOTE: Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]
    [[ NOTE: The EMail address uses 'asthe' and the web site URL uses 'isthe' ]]

See the BUGS file or try the help command:

    help bugs

for details on bug reporting.

One may join the calc testing group by sending a request to:

	calc-tester-request at asthe dot com

    [[ NOTE: Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]
    [[ NOTE: The EMail address uses 'asthe' and the web site URL uses 'isthe' ]]

    Your message body (not the subject) should consist of:

	subscribe calc-tester address
	end
	name your_full_name

    where "address" is your EMail address and "your_full_name"
    is your full name.
