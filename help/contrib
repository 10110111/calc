We welcome and encourage you to send us:

    * calc scripts
    * any builtin functions that you have modified or written
    * custom functions that you have modified or written
    * any other source code modifications

Prior to doing so, you should consider trying your changes on the most
recent alpha test code.  To obtain the most recent code, look under

	http://reality.sgi.com/chongo/calc/

You should also consider joining the calc testing group by sending a
request to:

	calc-tester-request@postofc.corp.sgi.com

    Your message body (not the subject) should consist of:

	subscribe calc-tester address
	end
	name your_full_name

    where "address" is your EMail address and "your_full_name"
    is your full name.

In order to consider integrating your code, we need:

    * help files (documentation)
    * CHANGES text (brief description of what it does)
    * regress.cal test (to test non-custom code)
    * your source code and/or source code changes (:-))

The best way to send us new code, if your changes are small, is
via a patch (diff -c from the latest alpha code to your code).
If your change is large, you should send entire files (either
as a diff -c /dev/null your-file patch, or as a uuencoded and
gziped (or compressed) tar file).

You should send submissions to:

	calc-tester@postofc.corp.sgi.com

Thanks for considering submitting code to calc.  Calc is a collective
work by a number of people.  It would not be what it is today without
your efforts and submissions!
