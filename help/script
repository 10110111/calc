Calc shell scripts
------------------

    If an executable file begins with:

	 #!/usr/local/bin/calc -S [-other_flags ...]

    the rest of the file will be processed in shell script mode.
    Note that -S (UPPER CASE -S) must be the first -flag on the
    ``#!'' line.  Any other optional ``-other_flags'' must come
    after the -S.

    In shell script mode the contents of the file are evaluated
    and executed as if they were processed by the read command.
    Any optional ``-other_flags'' will by parsed first followed
    by any arguments given shell script itself.

    In shell script mode, -s (lower case -s) is always assumed.
    In addition, -d and -p are automatically set if -i is not
    given.

    For example, if the file /tmp/mersenne:

	 #!/usr/local/bin/calc -S -q
	 #
	 # mersenne - an example of a calc shell script file

	 /* parse args */
	 if (argv() != 1) {
	   fprintf(files(2), "usage: %s exp\n", config("program"));
	   abort "must give one exponent arg";
	 }

	 /* print the mersenne number */
	 print "2^": argv(0) : "-1 =", 2^eval(argv(0))-1;

    is made an executable file by:

	 chmod +x /tmp/mersenne

    then the command line:

	 /tmp/mersenne 127

    will print:

	 2^127-1 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727

    Note that because -s is assumed in shell script mode and
    non-dashed args are made available as strings via the argv()
    builtin function.  Therefore:

	 2^eval(argv(0))-1

    will print the decimal value of 2^n-1 but

	 2^argv(0)-1

    will not.

For more information use the following calc commands:

    help usage
    help argv
    help config
    help cscript
