NAME
    frem - remove specified integer factors from specified integer

SYNOPSIS
    frem(x,y)

TYPES
    x		integer
    y		integer

    return	non-negative integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x and y are not zero and n is the largest non-negative integer
    for which y^n is a divisor of x, frem(x,y) returns abs(x/y^n).
    In particular, abs(x) is returned if x is not divisible by
    y or if abs(y) = 1.  If abs(y) > 1, frem(x,y) is the greatest
    divisor of x not divisible by y.

    For all x, frem(x,0) is defined to equal abs(x).

    For all y, frem(0,y) is defined to be zero.

    For all x and y, abs(x) = frem(x,y) * abs(y) ^ fcnt(x,y).

EXAMPLE
    > print frem(7,4), frem(24,4), frem(48,4), frem(-48,4)
    7 6 3 3

LIMITS
    none

LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qfacrem(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *y);
