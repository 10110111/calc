NAME
   scan - scan standard input for possible assignment to variables

SYNOPSIS
   scan(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)

TYPES
    x_1, x_2, ...	any

    return		integer

DESCRIPTION
   When input is from a terminal, execution is halted and input is read
   until a newline is entered.	Strings of non-whitespace characters
   are evaluated in succession and if the corresponding x_i is an lvalue,
   the resulting value is assigned to x_i.  If the number of strings
   read exceeds n, only the first n strings are evaluated.  If the number
   of strings is less than n, the later x_i are ignored.

EXAMPLE
    > global a, b, c, d;
    > scan(a, 0, c, d)
    > 2+3    b=a^2	  3+4i	   3+"a"
    > print a,b,c,d
	5 25 3+4i Error 3
