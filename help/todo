Calc Todo Items:

    The following items should be addressed sometime in the short to
    medium term future, if not before the next release.

    Code contributions are welcome.  Send patches to:

	    calc-tester at postofc dot corp dot sgi dot com

	    [[ Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]

    See also the 'wishlist' help files for the calc enhancement wish list.

    Calc bug reports, however, should send to:

	    calc-tester at postofc dot corp dot sgi dot com

	    [[ Replace 'at' with @, 'dot' is with . and remove the spaces ]]

    see the BUGS file or try the calc command:

	    help bugs

Very High priority items:

    * Write the help file for the display() builtin function.

    * Write the help file for the stoponerror() builtin function.

    * Update the errmax about the meaning of errmax(-1).

    * Review and if needed, correct/update the help topics:

	    topic		description
	    -----		-----------
	    intro		introduction to calc
	    overview		overview of calc
	    assoc		using associations
	    command		top level commands
	    config		configuration parameters
	    define		how to define functions
	    environment		how environment variables effect calc
	    errorcodes		calc generated error codes
	    expression		expression sequences
	    file		using files
	    history		command history
	    interrupt		how interrupts are handled
	    list		using lists
	    obj			user defined data types
	    operator		math, relational, logic and variable access ...
	    statement		flow control and declaration statements
	    types		builtin data types
	    unexpected		unexpected syntax/usage surprises for C ...
	    variable		variables and variable declarations
	    libcalc		using the arbitrary precision routines in ...
	    bugs		known bugs and mis-features
	    wishlist		wish list of future enhancements of calc

    * Fix any 'Known bugs' as noted in the BUGS file or as
      displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

    * Copyleft calc and place it under a LGPL.

High priority items:

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SEE ALSO' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LIBRARY' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LIMITS' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SYNOPSIS' and 'TYPES' help file sections.

    * Where reasonable, be sure that regress.cal tests builtin functions.

    * Perform a code coverage analysis of the 'make check' action
      and improve the coverage (within reason) of the regress.cal suite.

    * Create a Linux rpm (Red Hat Package Manager) package for calc.

    * Address, if possible and reasonable, any Calc Mis-features
      as noted in the BUGS file or as displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

    * The shell script that is currently constructed to display a help
      file (in help.c) is a gross hack.	 That code should be replaced
      with code that looks for the help file in the pre-defined help
      directories.  When the specific help file is found and opened,
      then a $PAGER should be forked and execed after doing things such
      as closing open file descriptors that the $PAGER does not need.

    * The arg passdown to the lower level Makfiles should be reviewed
      to determine which items really need to be passed down.  The lower
      level Makefiles should default to the shipped values.

    * Consider using configure to build the calc Makefile.

Medium priority items:

    * Complete the use of CONST where appropriate:

	CONST is beginning to be used with read-only tables and some
	function arguments.  This allows certain compilers to better
	optimize the code as well as alerts one to when some value
	is being changed inappropriately.  Use of CONST as in:

	    int foo(CONST int curds, char *CONST whey)

	while legal C is not as useful because the caller is protected
	by the fact that args are passed by value.  However, the
	in the following:

	    int bar(CONST char *fizbin, CONST HALF *data)

	is useful because it calls the compiler that the string pointed
	at by 'fizbin' and the HALF array pointer at by 'data' should be
	treated as read-only.

    * It is overkill to have nearly everything wind up in libcalc.a.

      One should make available a the fundamental math operations
      on ZVALUE, NUMBER and perhaps COMPLEX (without all of the
      other stuff) in a separate library.

    * Clean the source code and document it better.

    * Add a builtin function to access the 64 bit FNV hash which
      is currently being used internally in seed.c.
