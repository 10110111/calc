NAME
    feof - determine if end-of-file flag is set

SYNOPSIS
    feof(fd)

TYPES
    fd		file stream open for reading

    return	0 or 1

DESCRIPTION
    The function feof(fd) returns 1 or 0 according as the end-of-file flag
    is set or clear.

    The end-of-file flag for the stream fd is set if reading at the
    end-of-file position is attempted.	The flag is cleared by
    positioning operations (fseek, rewind, fsetpos) and by freopen.

EXAMPLE
    > fd1 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "w")
    > fputs(fd1, "Chongo was here\n")
    > fflush(fd1)
    > fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    > feof(fd2)
	    0
    > fgetline(fd2)
	    "Chongo was here"
    > feof(fd2)
	    0
    > fgetline(fd2)
    > feof(fd2)
	    1
