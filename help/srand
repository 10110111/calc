NAME
    srand - seed the additive 55 shuffle pseudo-random number generator

SYNOPSIS
    srand([seed])

TYPES
    seed	integer, matrix of integers or rand state

    return	rand state

DESCRIPTION
    See the pseudo-random number using an additive 55 shuffle generator.

    For integer seed != 0:

	Any buffered rand generator bits are flushed.  The additive table
	for the rand generator is loaded with the default additive table.
	The low order 64 bits of seed is xor-ed against each table value.
	The additive table is shuffled according to seed/2^64.

	The following calc code produces the same effect on the internal
	additive table:

	    /* reload default additive table xored with low 64 seed bits */
	    seed_xor = seed & ((1<<64)-1);
	    for (i=0; i < 55; ++i) {
	        additive[i] = xor(default_additive[i], seed_xor);
	    }

	    /* shuffle the additive table */
	    seed >>= 64;
	    for (i=55; seed > 0 && i > 0; --i) {
	        quomod(seed, i+1, seed, j);
	        swap(additive[i], additive[j]);
	    }

	Seed must be >= 0.  All seed values < 0 are reserved for future use.

	The additive table pointers are reset to additive[23] and additive[54].
	Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive values from the
	additive 55 generator.

	There is no limit on the size of a seed.  On the other hand,
	extremely large seeds require large tables and long seed times.
	Using a seed in the range of [2^64, 2^64 * 55!) should be
	sufficient for most purposes.  An easy way to stay within this
	range to to use seeds that are between 21 and 93 digits, or
	64 to 308 bits long.

	To help make the generator produced by seed S, significantly
	different from S+1, seeds are scrambled prior to use.  The
	internal function randreseed64 maps [0,2^64) into [0,2^64) in a
	1-to-1 and onto fashion for every 64 bits of S.

	The purpose of the randreseed64() is not to add security.  It
	simply helps remove the human perception of the relationship
	between the seed and the production of the generator.

	The randreseed64 process does not reduce the security of the
	rand genertator.  Every seed is converted into a different
	unique seed.  No seed is ignored or favored.  See the rand
	help file for details.

    For integer seed == 0:

	Restore the initial state and modulus of the rand generator.
	After this call, the rand generator is restored to its initial
	state after calc started.

	The additive 55 pointers are reset to additive[23] and additive[54].
	Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive values from the
	additive 55 generator.

	The call:

	    srand(0)

	restores the rand generator to the initial conditions at calc startup.

    For matrix arg:

	Any buffered random bits are flushed.  The additive table with the
	first 55 entries of the martix mod 2^64.

	The additive 55 pointers are reset to additive[23] and additive[54].
	Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive values from the
	additive 55 generator.

	This form allows one to load the internal additive 55 generator
	with user supplied values.

	The randreseed64 process is NOT applied to the matrix values.

    For rand state arg:

	Restore the rand state and return the previous state.  Note that
	the argument state is a rand state value (isrand(state) is true).
	Any internally buffered random bits are restored.

	All calls to srand(seed) return the previous state or current
	state in case of srand().  Their return value can be supplied
	to srand in restore the generator to that previous state:

	     state = srand(123456789);
	     newstate = srand();	/* save state */

	     x = rand();
	     ...
	     srand(newstate);	/* restore state to after srand(123456789) */
	     x1 = rand();	/* produces the same value as x */
	     ...
	     srand(state);	/* restore original state */

    For no arg given:

	Return current a55 generator state.  This call does not alter
	the generator state.

	This call allows one to take a snapshot of the current generator state.

    See the rand help file for details on the generator.
