NAME
    fgetline - read the next line from a file, newline is tossed

SYNOPSIS
    fgetline(fd)

TYPES
    fd		file

    return	str or nil

DESCRIPTION
    This function reads the next line, including any trailing newline from
    the open file associated with fd.  Unlike fgets, the trailing
    newline is removed from the return string.

    Empty lines return the null string.	 When the end of file is reached,
    fgetline returns the null value.  (Note the distinction between a null
    string and a null value.)

    If the line contained a numeric value, then the 'eval' function can
    then be used to convert the string to a numeric value.

    If a line is read, is returned minus the trailing newline, otherwise
    (EOF or ERROR) nil is returned.

EXAMPLE
    > fd = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "w")
    > fputs(fd, "chongo was here\n")
    > fputs(fd, "123\n")
    > fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    > fgets(fd2)
	    "chongo was here
    "

    > fclose(fd2)
    > fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    > fgetline(fd2)
	    "chongo was here"
    > eval(fgetline(fd2))
	    123

LIMITS
    fd must be associaed with an open file
