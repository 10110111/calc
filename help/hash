NAME
    hash - FNV-1 hash value

SYNOPSIS
    hash(x_1 [, x_2, x_3, ...])

TYPES
    x_1, x_1, ...	any

    return		integer v, 0 <= v < 2^32

DESCRIPTION
    Returns a hash value for one or more values of arbitrary types.

    The basis of this hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
    as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by:

	 Phong Vo (http://www.research.att.com/info/kpv/)
	 Glenn Fowler (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/)

    In a subsequent ballot round:

	 Landon Curt Noll (http://reality.sgi.com/chongo/)

    improved on their algorithm.  Some people tried this hash
    and found that it worked rather well.  In an EMail message
    to Landon, they named it ``Fowler/Noll/Vo'' or the FNV hash.

    FNV hashes are architected to be fast while maintaining a low
    collision rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots
    of data while maintaining a reasonable collision rate.  See:

    for more details as well as other forms of the FNV hash.

EXAMPLE
    > a = isqrt(2e1000); s = "xyz";
    > hash(a,s)
