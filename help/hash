NAME
    hash - hash value

SYNOPSIS
    hash(x_1 [, x_2, x_3, ...])

TYPES
    x_1, x_1, ...	any

    return		integer v, 0 <= v < 2^32

DESCRIPTION
    Returns a hash value for one or more values of arbitrary types.

    This function implements the Fowler/Noll/Vo hash-1 (FNV-1 hash).
    The basis of the hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
    by Email to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 mailing list from Phong Vo
    (kpv@research.att.com) and Glenn Fowler (gsf@research.att.com).
    Landon Curt Noll (http://reality.sgi.com/chongo) later improved on
    their algorithm to come up with Fowler/Noll/Vo hash.

    for more information in this hash.

EXAMPLE
    > a = isqrt(2e1000); s = "xyz";
    > hash(a,s)
	    1916476840

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 100.

LIBRARY
