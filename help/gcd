    gcd - greatest common divisor of a set of rational numbers

SYNOPSIS
    gcd(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ... rational number

    return	rational number

DESCRIPTION
    If at least one xi is nonzero, gcd(x1, x2, ...) is the
    greatest positive number g for which each xi is a multiple of g.
    If all xi are zero, the gcd is zero.

EXAMPLE
    > print gcd(12, -24, 30), gcd(9/10, 11/5, 4/25), gcd(0,0,0,0,0)
    6 .02 0

LIMITS
    The number of arguments may not to exceed 100.

LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qgcd(NUMBER *x1, NUMBER *x2)
