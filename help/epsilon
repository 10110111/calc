NAME
    epsilon - set or read the stored epsilon value

SYNOPSIS
    epsilon([eps])

TYPES
    eps		real number greater than 0 and less than 1

    return	real number greater than 0 and less than 1

DESCRIPTION
    Without args, epsilon() returns the current epsilon value.

    With one arg, epsilon(eps) returns the current epsilon value
    and sets the stored epsilon value to eps.

    The stored epsilon value is used as default value for eps in
    the functions appr(x, eps, rnd), sqrt(x, eps, rnd), etc.

EXAMPLE
    > oldeps = epsilon(1e-6)
    > print epsilon(), sqrt(2), epsilon(1e-4), sqrt(2), epsilon(oldeps)
    > .000001 1.414214 .000001 1.4142 .0001

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LIBRARY
    void setepsilon(NUMBER *eps)
    NUMBER *_epsilon_
