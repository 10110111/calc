NAME
    fseek - set a file position

SYNOPSIS
    fseek(fd, offset [, whence])

TYPES
    fd		open file stream
    pos		integer
    whence	0, 1 or 2, defaulting to 0

    return	null or error value

DESCRIPTION
    This function sets the file position indicator for the stream by
    adding offset to zero, the current value, or the size of the
    file, according as whence is 0, 1 or 2.  The effect is equivalent to
    moving the signed distance offset from the beginning, the current
    position, or the end of the file.

    The function also clears the end-of-file flag and flushes any
    buffered data waiting to be output to the stream.

    An implementation-defined error occurs if the effect would be to
    give a negative value to the position indicator; on some systems, the
    file position will be set to end-of-file.

    The file position indicator may have a value greater than the file
    size.  If characters are then written to the file, the gap is
    filled by null ('\0') characters.

EXAMPLE
    > fd = fopen("/tmp/curds", "w")
    > fputs(fd, "0123456789abcdef")
    > freopen(fd, "r")
    > fsize(fd)
	16
    > fseek(fd, 5)
    > fgets(fd)
	"56789abcdef"
    > fseek(fd, 0)
    > fscanf(fd, "%*5c")
	0
    > fseek(fd, 5, 1)
    > fgets(fd)
	"abcdef"
    > ftell(fd)
	16
    > fseek(fd, -5, 2)
    > fgets(fd)
	"bcdef"
    > fseek(fd, -2)
	System error 22
    > ftell(fd)
	16

    dependent, particularly for older systems.
