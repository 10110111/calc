NAME
    isptr - whether a value is a pointer

SYNOPSIS
    isptr(x)

TYPES
    x		any

    return	0, 1, 2, 3, or 4

DESCRIPTION
    isptr(x) returns:

		0 if x is a not pointer
		1 if x is an octet-pointer
		2 if x is a value-pointer
		3 if x is a string-pointer
		4 if x is a number-pointer

     Pointers are initially defined by using the addreess (&) operator
     with an "addressable" value; currently, these are octets, lvalues,
     strings and real numbers.

EXAMPLE
	> a = "abc", b = 3, B = blk()
	> p1 = &B[1]
	> p2 = &a
	> p3 = &*a
	> p4 = &*b
	> print isptr(a), isptr(p1), isptr(p2), isptr(p3), isptr(p4)
	0 1 2 3 4
