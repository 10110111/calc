Where to get the the latest versions of calc

    Landon Noll maintains the official calc ftp archive at:

	ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/calc

    Alpha test versions, complete with bugs, untested code and
    experimental features may be fetched (if you are brave) under:

	http://reality.sgi.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/

    One may join the calc testing group by sending a request to:

	calc-tester-request@postofc.corp.sgi.com

    Your message body (not the subject) should consist of:

	subscribe calc-tester address
	end
	name your_full_name

    where "address" is your EMail address and "your_full_name"
    is your full name.
