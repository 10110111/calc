NAME
    quomod - assign quotient and remainder to two variables

SYNOPSIS
    quomod(x, y, q, r)

TYPES
    x		real
    y		real
    q		any
    r		any

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns 0 or 1 according as x is or is not a multiple of y.
    Let  x = q * y + r  where q is an integer and 0 <= r < y
    This function assigns the values q and r to the variables
    Q and R.  If x >= 0, the results for Q and R are the same as
    those given by Q = x // y, R = x % y.

    XXX - need to document relationship with "quomod" config value

EXAMPLE
    > global u, v;
    > global mat M[2];
    > print quomod(13,5,u,v), u, v, quomod(15.6,5.2,M[0],M[1]), M[0], M[1];
    > 1 2 3 0 3 0
    > A = assoc();
    > print quomod(13, 5, A[1], A[2]), A[1], A[2]
    > 1 2 3

    XXX - need examples of how the "quomod" config file changes results

LIMITS
    y > 0

LIBRARY
    BOOL qquomod(NUMBER *q1, NUMBER *q2, NUMBER **retqdiv, NUMBER **retqmod)
