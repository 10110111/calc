NAME
    strcmp - compare two strings in the customary ordering of strings

SYNOPSIS
    strcmp(s1, s2)

TYPES
    s1		string
    s2		string

    return	integer (1, 0 or -1)

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(s2) and m = min(n1, n2).
    This function compares up to m values of consecutive characters
    in the strings s1 and s2. If an inequality is encountered, the
    function returns 1 or -1 according as the greater character is
    in s1 or s2. If there has been no inequality, the function
    returns 1, 0, or -1 according as n1 is greater than, equal to,
    or less than n2.
    Note that null characters within the strings are included in the
    comparison. 

EXAMPLE
    strcmp("ab", "abc") == -1
    strcmp("abc", "abb") == 1
    strcmp("abc", "abc") == 0
    strcmp("abc", "abd") == -1
    strcmp("abc\0", "abc") == 1
    strcmp("a\0b", "a\0c") == -1
