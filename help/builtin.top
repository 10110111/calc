Builtin functions

	There is a large number of built-in functions.  Many of the
	functions work on several types of arguments, whereas some only
	work for the correct types (e.g., numbers or strings).  In the
	following description, this is indicated by whether or not the
	description refers to values or numbers.  This display is generated
	by the 'show builtin' command.
