Dear calc user,

See the HOWTO.INSTALL file for information on how to build and install calc.

To be sure that your version of calc is up to date, check out:

	http://reality.sgi.com/chongo/calc/calc-download.html

We are interested in any/all feedback on recent versions of calc.
In particular we would like to hear about:

    * compiler warnings
    * compile problems
    * regression test problems (try: make check)
    * special compile flags/options that you needed
    * Makefile problems
    * help file problems
    * misc nits and typos

We would like to offer a clean compile across a wide verity of platforms,
so if you can test on several, so much the better!

If you run into problems, see the BUGS file.
