If you notice something wrong, strange or broken, try rereading:

   README.FIRST
   HOWTO.INSTALL
   BUGS (this file)

If that does not help, cd to the calc source directory and try:

   make check

Look at the end of the output, it should say something like:

    9998: passed all tests  /\../\
    9999: Ending regression tests

If it does not, then something is really broken!

If you made and modifications to calc beyond the simple Makefile
configuration, try backing them out and see if things get better.

To be sure that your version of calc is up to date, check out:

If you have tried all of the above and things still are not right,
then it may be time to send in a bug report.  You can send bug reports to:

    calc-tester@postofc.corp.sgi.com

When you send your report, please include the following information:

    * a description of the problem

    * the version of calc you are using (if you cannot get calc
      it to run, then send us the 4 #define lines from version.c)

    * if you modified calc from an official patch, send me the mods you made

    * the type of system you were using

    * the type of compiler you were using

    * any compiler warnings or erros that you saw

    * cd to the calc source directory, and type:

	make debug > debug.out 2>&1		(sh, ksh, bash users)
	make debug >& debug.out			(csh, tcsh users)

      and send the contents of the 'debug.out' file.

Stack traces from core dumps are useful to send as well.

Send any comments, compiler warning messages, suggestions and most
importantly, fixes (in the form of a context diff patch) to:

    calc-tester@postofc.corp.sgi.com

Known problems or mis-features:

    * Many of and SEE ALSO sections of help files
      for builtins are either inconsistent or missing information.

    * Many of the LIBRARY sections are incorrect now that libcalc.a
      contains most of the calc system.

    * There is some places in the source with obscure variable names
      and not much in the way of comments.  We need some major cleanup
      and documentation.
