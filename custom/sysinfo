NAME
    sysinfo - return a calc #define value

SYNOPSIS
    custom("sysinfo" [, infoname]);

TYPES
    infoname	string or int

    return	int, string or null

DESCRIPTION

    This custom function will return the value certain selected #defile
    values.  The infoname arg must be a string that matches the given
    #define name.  For conveience, the case infoname does not matter,
    so "baseb" and "BASEB" refer to the same #define value.

    The return value is either an integer or a string depending on
    the type of #define selected.  If infoname is unknown, NULL is returned.

    If no infoname is given then a list of infonames and meanings
    are printed.  In this case, null is returned.

    If infoname is a number, then it is interpreted as follows:

	0	print all infonames and meanings	(same as no infoname)
	1	print all infonames and values
	2	print all infoname meanings and values
